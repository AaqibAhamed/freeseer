Student
=======

We love working with students and having them solve fun and challenging problems.
For many, it's their first time contributing to an open source project.
We've had students from Google Summer of Code (GSoC), Undergraduate Capstone
Open Source Projects (UCOSP), and Fedora Summer Coding.

Getting Started
---------------
#. `Create a GitHub account <https://github.com/signup/free>`_
#. Introduce yourself on our :ref:`mailing list <mailing-list>`

   - Include your GitHub username so we can add you to the `Freeseer organization
     <https://github.com/Freeseer?tab=members>`_
#. Get familiar with IRC and start hanging out in :ref:`#freeseer on Freenode <irc>`
#. :ref:`Fork & clone Freeseer <fork-freeseer>`
#. Get Freeseer up and running, play around with it, look at the source code
#. Read over the `assessment document
   <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p9DtTujpSMj_i5mXVfUGtzvJS02rwpf9RvSK65ayklo/edit>`_
#. Copy the `project proposal document
   <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1it9UJo91tDGB1Cf2Qyn3rAzXX8icxoBZI183eqjASUc/edit>`_
   to your Google Drive
   
   - ``File`` â†’ ``Make a copy``
   - Change the sharing settings so **anyone with the link can view and
     comment**, then share the link with us
   - Replace the highlighted sections with your own content
#. Bookmark the style guides that we use:
   `PEP 8 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_ and
   `Google's Python Style Guide
   <http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pyguide.html>`_

   - Reference them when writing code
#. Sign up for a blogging platform (or use your own website)

   - Share the URL on the mailing list
#. Start thinking of ways how you can improve Freeseer!

.. tip::
  As a student, you can apply for a **free micro account** at
  `github.com/edu <http://github.com/edu>`_ and get 5 private repositories!

What Happens at the Sprint
--------------------------

Depending on which program you're participating in, you may have to attend
a `sprint <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(software_development)>`_ with
your new teammates. Use the sprint to ask questions, help your teammates,
brainstorm what to work on, get started on your project proposal, open a pull
request, make new friends, and generally have a good time.

We'll also decide on a time for our weekly G+ hangouts, which are done `scrum
style <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)#Meetings>`_.
Each team member will briefly update the others with what they've accomplished
since the last meeting, what they will be working on next, and any stumbling
blocks they ran into. Any detailed discussion should happen outside the meeting.


Deciding What To Work On
------------------------

We let students choose their projects. We'll suggest a couple of project ideas.
You can also look through our `open issues
<https://github.com/Freeseer/freeseer/issues?labels=&page=1&state=open>`_ or
come up with your own idea and open an issue for it.

You should have a copy of the `project proposal document
<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1it9UJo91tDGB1Cf2Qyn3rAzXX8icxoBZI183eqjASUc/edit>`_
on your Google Drive. Feel free to add or remove sections that you think are
relevant or irrelevant to your project. It also includes a timeline to help
schedule your work. There are no set work hours -- meet your deadlines and
you'll be fine. Decide with your professor and/or project mentor when your
exact end date will be.

Done is better than perfect when it comes to your proposal. Don't spend too much
(or too little) time on it. Iterate on it quickly and often, you don't need
a highly polished document on your first try.

When you finish your first draft of the proposal, notify everyone on the
mailing list and include a link so they can view it on Google Drive.
We'll give you feedback so you can make any changes if necessary.

.. note::
  You can `add or update translations
  <http://freeseer.github.io/docs/contribute/translation.html>`_
  in addition to your main project.

.. tip::
  Start working on your project while your proposal is still in progress.

Stay In Touch
-------------

A good analogy is driving to a destination. Imagine a friend is driving and
you're the navigator. The more updates you give your driver, the sooner and
safer you'll get to your destination. On the other hand, rarely updating your
driver with directions can get you easily lost or you may not reach your
destination on time.

Same goes with your teammates in a project. If you update them frequently, they
can help you out often and give you feedback on your work so there's less chance
of screwing up. But if no one knows what you're working on or if you're having
difficulties, then by the time they find out it may be too late to make changes
or get help.

In addition to being active on the mailing list and IRC, you'll be required to
write a few blog posts about your progress. There's usually one at the
beginning, one at the midpoint of the term, and one at the end, but feel free to
write more!

You may write your blog posts at `fosslc.org <http://www.fosslc.org>`_ (you'll
have to register an account first).  Or, if you prefer, you may use your own
blog. Just tell us on the mailing list where we can read your latest blog post.


Expectations
------------

* Be available for others to contact you
* Communicate often: be active on IRC, the mailing list, and status updates
* Be a team player, not just a teammate
* Post updates often, let us know when you completed a feature or if you're having difficulty
* Ask for help when you need it!
* 8-10 hours of work per week


How To Succeed
--------------

* Choose an appropriate project that you can realistically accomplish
* We don't expect you to be completely qualified, that's the point, you're here to learn
