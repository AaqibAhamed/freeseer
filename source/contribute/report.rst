Reporting Bugs & Requesting Features
====================================

.. rubric:: 1. Search

We troubleshoot and discuss features in public. If you've found a bug or have
an idea, take a few minutes to see if it's already been documented.

Search our :doc:`documentation </index>`, :ref:`mailing list <mailing-list-label>`,
`issue tracker <https://github.com/Freeseer/freeseer/issues>`_, and
`IRC log <https://botbot.me/freenode/freeseer/>`_.

.. rubric:: 2. Ask

Contact us before opening a new issue, otherwise you risk it being closed for
reasons such as it being a known issue, previously rejected idea, or off-topic.

Hop in our :ref:`IRC channel <irc-label>` or send an email to the
:ref:`mailing list <mailing-list-label>` and describe your problem or idea.

Keep in mind that none of us are paid to work on Freeseer, we are all volunteers
helping out in our free time. You may not get an immediate response.

.. rubric:: 3. Open a new issue

After searching and contacting us, `open an issue
<https://github.com/Freeseer/freeseer/issues/new>`_ if none exist and
reference any existing related issues that you know of.

If you're a new contributor, please use one of the templates below.
