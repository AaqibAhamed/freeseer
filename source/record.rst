Freeseer's primary use case is recording large events such as conferences.
This page documents how we use Freeseer for events and how we recommend you do too.

Equipment Needed
-------------
* A working installation of Freeseer
* VGA Capture Device (we recommend an Epiphan device)
* Wireless Microphones (we recommend ...)

Setup
-----

.. todo::

Preparation
-----------
* Use the Talk Editor tool to enter all the talks and their info beforehand.
* Have the speakers disable their screen saver and power saving mode.
  If the presenter's laptop goes into power saving mode,
  then the vga2usb device loses the signal and you will have to pause and restart
  the recording.

  * Linux users can use the caffeine app::

      sudo add-apt-repository ppa:caffeine-developers/ppa
      sudo apt-get update
      sudo apt-get install caffeine

Hosting the Videos
------------------
FOSSLC.org can host your videos for free if the talks are open source related.
We promote them on the site and host them on YouTube.
We get quite a few hits on our website from various communities.

Of course, you can always use your own hosting solution.
