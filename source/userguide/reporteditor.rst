The editor provides a simple interface which displays all submitted reports found in the database. Selecting a report
will show the full details on which talk applies to the selected report on the right. 

There are a few actions which can be done with this interface.

* Double clicking a cell will allow the user to modify the data of that cell
* Clicking **Remove** will remove the currently selected row from the database
* Clicking **Clear** will clear the entire report database after the user confirms via confirmation dialog box
* Clicking **Close** will close the Report Editor
