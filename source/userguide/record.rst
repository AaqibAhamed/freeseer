Report Tool
-----------

Occasionally when doing a recording issues could occur such as the audio not working, video is not working or perhaps
the presenter does not wish to be recorded. After a conference it is difficult for one person to know which talks have
issues, especially if 100s of talks are recorded at the event.

To solve this issue Freeseer comes with a basic reporting tool that will allow the person recording to report issues
with their talks inside the application. This will allow whomever is uploading the videos after the talk to quickly
scan through and find which videos have issues.

To access the reporting interface, with freeseer-record open simply click Help > Report. The reporting interface will 
open a basic form for the currently selected talk.

The form has 3 fields which need to be assessed by the reporter.

A comment describing the issue seen.
A type of issue, one of “No Issue”, “No Audio”, “No Video”, and “No Audio/Video”.
A checkbox indicating if a Release Form was received or not.
The last item is a new feature we added for events where presenters must sign a release form indicating they are 
giving permission to record their talk. Typicially this option is used with the “No Issue” flag unless there are 
issues with the recording.

After an event is complete the organizer can use the :ref:`report-editor` to view the submitted reports.
